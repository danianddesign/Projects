			<h2> Lavender London Fog Crepe Cake</h2>
			<p>Delicate, aromatic, and quietly indulgent, this Lavender London Fog Crepe Cake is a celebration of slow baking and layered comfort. Paper-thin crepes are gently stacked with a silky lavender-infused frosting, creating soft tiers that echo the warmth of a classic London Fog—bergamot-kissed Earl Grey tea, creamy milk, and a whisper of floral sweetness. The result is a cake that feels both refined and familiar: lightly floral without being perfumed, rich yet airy, and meant to be savored one slice at a time. Perfect for afternoon tea, special gatherings, or a calm weekend bake, this crepe cake invites you to linger, pour another cup, and enjoy the ritual as much as the reward.</p>

			<h3> Process </h3>
			<h4> Crepes</h4>
			<ol><li>Make the crepes; combine milk, water, and eggs in a bowl.</li>
			<li>Add the flour and sugar and whisk until you have a smooth batter.</li>
			<li>Heat a 9-inch non-stick skillet over medium heat. Spray it gently with some cooking spray.</li>
			<li>Pour around 3 tablespoon of the batter onto the skillet and swirl the batter until the skillet top is fully covered</li>
			<li>Cook the crepe for 1 minute. Lift it gently and flip and cook for another 30 seconds.</li>
			<li>Place the cooked crepe onto a wire rack. Repeat the process with the remaining batter.</li>
			<li> Set the cooked crepes aside while you make the filling.</li>
			<h4> Filling </h4>
			<li>Make the filling; beat the softened butter and condensed milk until fluffy.</li>
			<li>Add the cream cheese, lavender, food coloring and vanilla extract. Beat until smooth.</li>
			<li>Add one crepe to a plate or cake stand. Drop 1 scoop of the filling onto the crepe. Spread the filling to the edges and top with another crepe. </li>
			<li>Repeat the layers until you have used all of the crepes. Top with the remaining filling.</li>
			<li>Refrigerate the cake for 2-3 hours before slicing and serving for the best results (you can eat it immediately, but it’s best chilled).</li>
